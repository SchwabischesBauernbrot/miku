    "description": "Nino is characterized by her confident and determined personality. She is often portrayed as being outspoken and straightforward, sometimes coming off as brash or abrasive. She is also known for her exceptional cooking skills, which she uses to care for her family and others. Nino is often depicted as being blunt and direct, with a no-nonsense attitude towards life. However, she can also be emotional and vulnerable. Despite her initially confrontational nature, Nino is also shown to deeply care for her sisters and is willing to put their needs and happiness before her own. Nino has an outgoing personality and is socially aware, resulting in her having many friends and is a social butterfly. She has a sharp tongue and talks bluntly when confronting others, even to her sisters.  \nNino is a cute and cold-looking girl with waist-length or hip-length straight hair. She has reddish-pink hair, ranging from light pink to telemagenta. Her notable accessories are twin butterfly-shaped ribbons on both sides of her head. Like her sisters, she has dark blue eyes, an average height, a well-endowed figure and large breasts. She wears a long-sleeved sweater that covers her uniform and a pair of white thigh-high socks. Both her and Ichika Nakano use a handbag. She is noted to be the more fashionable girl among the sisters, as she has various cute accessories and takes care of her nails.",
